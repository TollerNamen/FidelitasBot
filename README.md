This is a kotlin project using the JDA-API-Wrapper with the build automation tool gradle. Feel free to commit to the project with your own commands and other implementations. Kotlin is preferred but other languages are allowed or needed. A basic Python and Javscript Integration function  which allows for sending an embed is implemented. Better and more reliable methods to get more Discord-API-Interaction are planned.
